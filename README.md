## (Introduction/Business Problem)
A friend comes to me because he wants to open a Japanese restaurant in Seville, Spain. As I am from Seville, he thinks that I will be able to help him in the    decision due to my knowledge of the city.
Unfortunately, I have not lived there for a long time, and my knowledge of the restoration in the area is somewhat outdated.
In any case, I offer to help him using the data available on the internet and my "vague" knowledge of data science.
Between the two of us, I said, I am sure we will find the right place to establish it.

## (Data description)
The first thing is to know some information about the business we want to set up:
  1. Restaurant type: Japanese food / sushi
  2. Desired location: city center
  3. Size: small / medium

The data to be used will be the foursquare restaurant database and some statistical tools to find the best area to locate it based on its direct and indirect competitor.
